Consider having installed:

Steps:

1. Clone this repository

3. Run `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/ClientTest.php` and `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/BookingTest.php` (requires php >= 7.3 if you use other version please update composer.json file first)

Also, we recommend you read the code so that you are not caught off guard.
