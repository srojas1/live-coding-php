# PHP Live Coding Challenge

Before joining the live coding challenge, you should have set up the local environment for the application.

Consider having installed:
- Composer (for ubuntu: sudo apt install composer)
- PHP 7.3^ and extension: php-xml (for ubuntu: sudo apt install php-xml)

Steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/ClientTest.php` and `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/BookingTest.php` (requires php >= 7.3 if you use other version please update composer.json file first)

Also, we recommend you read the code so that you are not caught off guard.

# What does the live coding looks like?
